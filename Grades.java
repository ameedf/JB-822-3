/**
 * Write a program that will compute some statistics about students grades.
 * It will ask the user to enter the user to enter the number of students.
 * Then, the program will ask the user to enter the grades one by one.
 * The range of each grade is an integer between 0 and 100.
 * Make sure to use an array where the type is the closest to this range (hint: don't use an array of "int"'s).
 * If the user enters a number which is not in range, the program will ask him to enter a new grade.
 * Once the user entered all the grades, the program will print:
 * 1. The highest grade and its index (something like: the student #10 got the highest grade and it's 98).
 * 2. The lowest grade and its index (something like: the student #3 got the lowest grade and it's 13).
 * 3. The average of the grades
