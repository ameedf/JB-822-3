/**
 * Your assignment is to create the game "Guess The Number". Here's a description of the game:
 * (Taken from "http://www.goobix.com/games/guess-the-number/")
 * Guess The Number is a game where you must use your logic in order to guess a 4-digit secret number
 * selected by the computer at the beginning of the game. The number is formed with digits from 0 to 9;
 * each digit appears once at most. This number is guessed by you via multiple attempts. An attempt
 * consists in a proposed number, selected by you, and the computer's reply. The computer must tell you,
 * in his reply, how many digits have you guessed on the same position, and how many digits have you
 * guessed on a different position. Using information from the computer's reply, you must guess the
 * number using as few moves as possible.
 * <p>
 * 1. Your implementation must be done using ONLY thing we've learned
 * 2. BEFORE entering a new guess by the user, the program will show the previous guesses and their results
 *
 * BONUS: add some more statistics about the users:
 * At the beginning of a new game, the user is asked to enter his unique number (from 1 to 100)
 * The user is given the chance to enter the number of digits to guess (not only 4)
 * When the user finally guesses the digits, the number of steps will be updated in the high-scores table
 * The user will be told about his position in the high-scores table at the end of his game (for example,
 * "There are X players with better scores") or if he's at the top of the table.
 * Before the next game, the top 3 scores (which are greater than 0) will be printed
